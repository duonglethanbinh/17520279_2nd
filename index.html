                <td>Welcome to <strong>Ho Chi Minh City</strong> 
                    Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) is Vietnam at its most dizzying: a high-octane city of commerce and culture
                    that
                    has driven the country forward with its pulsating energy. A chaotic whirl, the city breathes life
                    and
                    vitality into all who settle here, and visitors cannot help but be hauled along for the ride.<br>
                    From the finest of hotels to the cheapest of guesthouses, the classiest of restaurants to the
                    tastiest
                    of street stalls, the choicest of boutiques to the scrum of the markets, HCMC is a city of energy
                    and
                    discovery.<br>
                    Wander through timeless alleys to incense-infused temples before negotiating chic designer malls
                    beneath
                    sleek 21st-century skyscrapers. The ghosts of the past live on in buildings that one generation ago
                    witnessed a city in turmoil, but now the real beauty of the former Saigon’s urban collage is the
                    seamless blending of these two worlds into one exciting mass.</td>

                <td><strong>Hanoi</strong>, the thousand-year-old cultural capital of Vietnam, is the center of culture and politics of
                    the country with preferential natural landscapes as well as the historical monuments, the intangible
                    cultural heritage such as Ca Tru singing, etc. All of them has created the unique attraction of
                    Hanoi. Since the country innovation, Hanoi tourism has been increasingly developed with a lot of
                    different types of tourism. Hanoi tourism is supported by high quality infrastructure, diversity of
                    hotels from 2 stars to 5 stars, restaurant systems with Asia and Western dishes, etc. Hanoi is the
                    transshipment of international tourists coming to Vietnam. The number of international as well as
                    domestic tourists visiting Hanoi annually increases. However, there are many problems which need to
                    overcome for Hanoi tourism, for example, poor transport systems, traffic chaos, serious
                    environmental pollution due to rapid urbanization and food safety.</td>
